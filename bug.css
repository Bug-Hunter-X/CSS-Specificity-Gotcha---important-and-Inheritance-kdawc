The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
.container {
  font-size: 16px;
}

.container p {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  font-size: 14px !important;
}
```

In this example, the `p` element inside the `.container` class inherits the `font-size: 16px` from its parent. However, the `!important` flag on `font-size: 14px` in the global `p` selector overrides the inherited value, even though the parent's selector is more specific.

This behavior can lead to unexpected styling if not properly understood.  The `!important` flag should be used sparingly, as it can make CSS harder to maintain and debug.
